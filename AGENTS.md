# Agent guidelines

## Auto-commit

After generating code, add all changes to the staging index using `git add .` and create a commit. Use the name and language model for the commit author.

## Tests

- When provided with an implementation request with Gherkin notation (Given/When/Then), treat it as specification by example.
- In the generated tests, add the steps of the Gherkin notation as comments right before the implementation of the respective step in the test. So there is a comment with a step specification, then some go code, then potentially another comment with a step specification and so on.
- Do not create tests for the "cmd" package.
